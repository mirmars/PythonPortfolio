This document is in development. It demonstrates dashboard building, currently using uploaded CSV format data sources which I have cleaned, prepped, and uploaded. 
Custom Looker formulas have been made to produce metrics like tiered dimensions (see: age and income) and combined dimensions from related boolean columns (see: household status and education),
as well as key marketing metrics like conversion rate and return on ad spend (ROAS).

I'm currently searching for a more robust data set to demonstrate more key metrics, like click-through rate (CTR) and churn rate, as well. Expect new additions soon!
