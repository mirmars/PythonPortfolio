    "MirMars: The NYT webpage has changed since the reported solution on the exercise page was crafted! It no longer uses a neat story-heading class, and in fact uses many classes for its article titles. I was able to get most of the titles using the following code while parsing out author names that it also picked up, but this could be improved with more time investment to fine-tune for outliers (for example, there's currently one article that uses an h2 instead of an h3, so creating multiple Title variables could pick up additional lines.)"
